# Efficient Stack Solver using A* Search
AI project for stacking up blocks in ascending order by pre-determining an efficient way to minimize total pus-pops needed to reach the goal state.
The Solver uses A* search to determine the next good move such that it is able to solve the stack in least number of steps.
